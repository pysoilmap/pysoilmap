This project does currently not contain meaningful functionality, and it is
currently lacking a clear vision. After some consideration I decided that the
original intended scope of the project was too far-reaching.

An updated idea could sound like this:

This project aims to provide examples and utilities for common tasks related
to DSM. For some of these tasks, we also want to work on high-level user
interfaces, accessible via python APIs or the command line. The actual legwork
is done by established libraries. Custom solutions are implemented where
needed or more convenient.

For more info, see Roadmap_.

For now, you might find the examples in the docs or the list of Resources_
useful.


Resources
~~~~~~~~~

This is a list of some useful python packages and other resources in the
context of DSM:

Data formats:

- geopandas_: for vector data (shapefiles, .gpkg, etc.). I recommend saving
  data as .gpkg (not shapefiles) to get a single self-contained file.
- rasterio_: for GeoTIFF files
- xarray_ for NetCDF (.nc) files. It can also read GeoTIFF if rasterio is
  installed.
- GDAL_ of courseâ€¦ (``import osgeo.gdal``)
- (exifread_ can read metadata from TIFFs)
- (pyshp_: read/write raw shapefiles, without the overhead or convenience of
  geopandas)
- (xlrd_ to read excel files via ``pandas.read_excel``)

Roadmap
~~~~~~~

In the future, we plan on working the following topics:

- common easy-to-use interface (like scikit-learn) for several machine
  learning models for linear regression, kriging, regression-kriging, random
  forests, ...
- examples for plotting raster and vector data
- examples for reprojection, resampling (using rasterio/gdal)
- sampling points from vector datasets
- custom (non-stationary) GP kernels for DSM
- algorithms for experimental design (DOE)
- 3D terrain survey
- ...?
